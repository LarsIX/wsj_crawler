OUTLOOK. Jan. 1, 545 pm. ET 834 3 min. Secretary of. Defense. Lloyd. Austin. Good news. The. U.S. military isn't packed with violent extremists. That's the gist of a new report commissioned in and released quietly with little notice in. December. The result won't surprise. Americans who have spent time in uniform, but it should calm the media frenzy about right-wing radicals in the armed forces. 2549 1x. After reports that some service members participated in the. Jan. 6 riot,. Defense. Secretary. Lloyd. Austin ordered an independent study to get \"greater fidelity\" on extremism in the ranks. The think tank tasked with the report, the. Institute for. Defense. Analyses. IDA, \"found no evidence that the number of violent extremists in the military is disproportionate\" to. U.S. society. A review of. Pentagon data suggested \"fewer than 100 substantiated cases per year of extremist activity the military in recent years,\" the report says. That figure could include a range of conduct and ideological bent, not simply the white supremacy floated in the press. Take court martials. Researchers found that \"the prevalence of extremist and gang-related activity that are reflected in court-martial opinions is limited to fewer than 20 cases\" since . Gang activity isn't typically political and, excluding those cases, the number falls to one a year. One useful conclusion is that the military doesn't need a new section of the. Uniform. Code of. Military. Justice to punish what few \"extremist\" criminal cases exist. Researchers note that commanders can rely on. Article 116 riot or breach of peace;. Article 88 contempt toward officials;. Article 109 destruction or damage to property;. Article 115 communication of threats, among others such as assault. Even the. Jan. 6 story isn't what you've heard. IDA found that \"of the more than 700 federal cases in which charges were publicly available a year after these events, fewer than ten\" were in the military at the time. There's \"no evidence that service members were charged at a different rate than the members of the general population.\". The picture changes when veterans are included, though the. Pentagon doesn't command former service members who are civilians. But the inquisition into extremism does polarize the active force. Researchers deserve credit for noting that \"the risk to the military from widespread polarization and division in the ranks may be a greater risk than the radicalization of a few service members.\". This is a welcome rebuke to the narrative that the military is a breeding ground for domestic terrorism. The press carried that story everywhere in , including calls for tips \"Have. You. Witnessed. Far-Right. Extremism. Inside the. Military?\". But the press interest in military extremism has outstripped the actual extremists available to cover. A. Rand survey found that, among veterans, support for \"extremist groups and extremist ideals\" is similar to or less than the general public. The. U.S. military reflects the strengths and weaknesses of. American society. But it has a strong culture that keeps men and women from joining the political fringes.

OUTLOOK. OptumRx seeks to disqualify. Motley. Rice for a conflict of interest. Jan. 1, 545 pm. ET 116 3 min. The plaintiffs bar never met a business it wouldn't sue, and now the lawyers are using government authority to pursue private interests. In their latest business model, trial lawyers are hired general to help prosecute public lawsuits then use it to the advantage of their private lawsuits. Kudos to one company for pushing back. In. December pharmacy benefit manager. OptumRx filed a motion in federal court in. Ohio to disqualify. Motley. Rice, a. South. Carolina plaintiffs firm suing the company in multidistrict opioid litigation. Motley has been retained general and city prosecutors in. Washington,. D.C.,. Hawaii and. Chicago to handle the government's litigation, but it continues to represent private clients in related litigation. This double dipping would break the rules of professional conduct in nearly any industry, but it's an open scandal in the tort business. In a typical arrangement, trial lawyers are hired as \"special assistant attorneys general\" on a given case, a designation that confers advantages during legal discovery. The lawyers then turn around and information to benefit private lawsuits where they can make millions in contingency fees. In its motion to disqualify. Motley. Rice,. OptumRx notes that under the. Ohio. Rules of. Professional. Conduct, lawyers are barred from knowingly having \"confidential government information about a person, acquired when the lawyer was a public officer or employee\" and from representing a \"private client whose interests are adverse to that person.\". In its role working on state opioid lawsuits,. Motley served subpoenas that required. Optum to deliver what it called \"wide swaths of confidential business records and testimony.\". Faced with the government subpoenas, the company \"produced thousands of pages of confidential information\" and sent the documents \"directly to. Motley. Rice.\". With that information,. Motley continued litigating its private cases against. Optum and other pharmacy benefit managers on opioid matters. The. Optum motion, along with the consolidated opioid litigation, is before federal. Judge. Aaron. Polster, who has pushed the parties to reach settlements. In a recent telephone hearing,. Judge. Polster is reported to have told. OptumRx lawyer. Brian. Boone that he should think twice about filing the disqualification motion against the trial lawyers, whom he considers to be cooperative. \"Your clients need to understand if they file these motions, it will be very difficult to maintain that level of professional cooperation, and that will clearly have negative repercussions for your clients,\". Judge. Polster said, according to. Law360, a legal news website which got a transcript of the hearing. \"I don't need to spell it out. But if they're not listening you ought to explain to them exactly what. I mean.\". That's loud and clear. Judge. Polster is discouraging. Optum's lawyers from filing a motion that reflects poorly on. Motley. Rice. But if companies can't challenge the trial lawyers' alliance with state attorneys general, they are destined to be saddled with bills for the opioid epidemic regardless of legal liability. The opioid crisis is a tragedy with many causes, but using government authority for the enrichment of the trial bar is not a triumph of justice. Journal. Editorial. Report.

Supreme. Leader. Xi. Jinping offered his traditional. New. Year's greeting. Monday with a warning. \"The reunification of the motherland is a historical inevitability,\". Mr. Xi said, according to the. Chinese-language version documented sources. \"Compatriots on both sides of the. Taiwan. Strait should be bound by a common sense of purpose and in the glory of the rejuvenation of the. Chinese nation,\" he added. The official. English translation wrote \"all. Chinese\" rather than \"compatriots,\" according to a. Reuters dispatch. The language comes 12 days before. Taiwan's voters go to the polls in a hotly contested three-way race for. President. Chinese propaganda is working hard against front-runner. Lai. Ching-te, the current vice president and presidential nominee of the ruling. Democratic. Progressive and his party are obstacles to coerced reunification. One big question for the. New. Year is how does. China react if. Mr. Lai wins? Does. Mr. Xi tell his military to increase its harassment of. Taiwan airspace and waters? Or, with two hot wars around the word and an election year in the. U.S. that is likely to be highly divisive, will he try something more daring? The. White. House thinks its recent parlays with. Beijing have put. U.S.-China bilateral relations on a more stable course. Perhaps that's right. But it's worth recalling that, in the. Chinese. Lunar. Calendar, is the. Year of the. Dragon, and to prepare accordingly.

      "4    Israel. Reshuffles. Forces,. Prepares for. Long-Term. Conflict in. Gaza 11 minutes. TEL. AVIVIsrael began preparations for prolonged fighting in the. Gaza. Strip, reshuffling forces as it weighs how to sustain lower-intensity fighting over the long term. Israel's top general said that it would take at least several more months to destroy. Hamas's military capabilities in the enclave. On. Monday,. Israel said it would adjust its ground-force composition in. Gaza, with plans to rotate five brigadesestimated to be thousands of troopsout of the. Gaza. Strip this week, some of which might be replaced. The military has also recalibrated the types of troops required, now relying more heavily on commando and combat-engineering forces, as. Israel increasingly tries to penetrate subterranean tunnel infrastructure and hunt down senior. Hamas leadership. \"These adaptations are designed to ensure planning and preparation for ,\". Daniel. Hagari, the. Israeli military's chief spokesperson, said. Sunday night. \"The war's goals require prolonged fighting, and we are preparing accordingly.\". The prospect of an extended period of hostilities in. Gaza comes amid friction between. Israel and the. U.S., its main ally, which has been pushing the government of. Prime. Minister. Benjamin. Netanyahu to begin winding down a war that has devastated the enclave and killed thousands. One. U.S. official said that. Israel's decision to change the composition of its forces in. Gaza appears to be in line with a broader shift the. Biden administration has been advocating toward the more discriminate use of force on the part of. Israel's military. Palestinians in. Rafah, a city in. Gaza, waited. Sunday to receive food prepared at a charity kitchen. \"This appears to be the start of the gradual shift to lower-intensity operations in the north that we have been encouraging, which reflects the success the. IDF has had in dismantling. Hamas's military capabilities there,\" the official said, referring to. Israel. Defense. Forces. Other. Western officials were more cautious, saying that more time was needed to see how the next phase of. Israel's military campaign unfolds. American officials have repeatedly said that it is imperative that. Hamas be defeated but that. Israeli forces need to show more care to minimize civilian casualties. On. Sunday, the. United. Nations said 40 of the. Gaza population is at risk of famine and all children under 5 years oldor a total of about 335,000are at high risk of severe malnutrition. The war has displaced 85 of the population and pushed almost all. Gazans into poverty, according to the. U.N., amid a daily struggle to find food and avoid. Israeli airstrikes. While some. Western officials and analysts have questioned whether. Israel can succeed in its goal of eradicating. Hamas, the new military plans reflect the country's determination to continue to pursue that goal. Swapping out forces who have been serving for long periods in. Gaza is important to refresh weary troops ahead of a planned long campaign. Moreover, demobilizing a portion of the about 360,000 reservists called up for duty since. Oct. 7 will ease pressure on. Israel's workforce and its economy. Cycling out brigades from northern. Gaza suggests that. Israel has largely transitioned from offensive to consolidation efforts, according to. Ofer. Shelah, a military analyst with. Tel. Aviv's. Institute for. National. Security. Studies. \"Once you stop advancing and you take over or you demolish enough infrastructure, to stay there with so many soldiers is what guerrilla forces want you to do,\" he said. The war in. Gaza has sparked tensions elsewhere in the. Middle. East and has raised the risk of a broader confrontation between. Iran, which has backed. Hamas in its goal of destroying. Israel, and the. U.S., which has moved aircraft carriers and other military support to the area to deter. Iran and its allies from attacking. Israel. A. Palestinian woman collected items. Monday from the rubble of her home in. Rafah. Over the weekend,. U.S. Navy helicopters sank three boats piloted , a. Yemeni group backed by. Iran, after those boats threatened a commercial vessel in the. Red. Sea. There have been more than 20. Houthi attacks on commercial vessels since. November. The. USS. Gerald. R. Ford carrier strike group will be leaving the region in the coming days, defense officials said. A second carrier, the. Dwight. D. Eisenhower, will continue operating in the. Red. Sea. Since the. Oct. 7 start of the war, the. U.S. also has deployed additional destroyers and amphibious assault ships throughout the region. Tasnim, an. Iranian semiofficial news agency close to the country's security establishment, said. Monday that an. Iranian destroyer has been moved to the. Red. Sea near the. Bab el-Mandeb. Strait, a key crossing between the. Indian. Ocean and the. Red. Sea. The clash between the. Houthis and the. U.S. Navythe first involving close combat between. U.S. forces and the militantsposes the question of whether the. Biden administration should retaliate against the militants to deter further such aggression. The. Israeli military said it's the largest underground passageway, about 2 miles long, that they have found so far built. Gaza. WSJ's. Dov. Lieber reports from the. Israel-Gaza border, giving an inside look at the tunnel. The. Obama administration carried out cruise-missile strikes in against coastal radar sites controlled . That action was described at the time as \"limited self-defense strikes,\" and they were carried out after the. Houthis fired missiles at a. U.S. destroyer. The. Biden administration has been more cautious in the face of persistent. Houthi attacks against commercial shipping, as it seeks to avoid broadening the fighting in the region. On. Saturday,. U.S. Defense. Secretary. Lloyd. Austin spoke with. Grant. Shapps, the. British defense secretary. Both agreed that the. Houthi attacks were \"profoundly destabilizing to the international rules-based order,\" the. Pentagon said, and. Austin noted that \"collective action\" was needed. The. U.S. is working with. Britain and other countries on a joint statement that would bluntly warn the. Houthis against continuing their attacks, a. U.S. official said. On. Monday,. U.S. forces in. Syria were the target of two attacks, one and the other by a drone, according to. U.S. officials. Since mid-October, there have been at least 115 attacks on. U.S. and allied forces in. Syria and. Iraq, with many of them claimed by. Iran-backed militants. Israeli soldiers cleaning munitions. Monday in. Israel after returning from the. Gaza. Strip. Israel launched what has become one of its most costly recent conflicts after. Hamasa group designated by the. U.S. as a terrorist organizationattacked southern. Israel on. Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping more than 240. According to the. Palestinian. Central. Bureau of. Statistics, more than 22,000 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in. Gaza since the war broke out. The figures don't distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths. According to the health ministry in. Hamas-controlled. Gaza, 57,000 have been injured. Shahd. Swairki, 35 years old, who fled her home in. Gaza. City in the north to. Rafah, a town on the border with. Egypt, said that food is available in the south, but at very high prices. She is crowded with her extended family in a rented apartment. Many other displaced families are in tents. The lack of cooking gas has forced people to burn wood, or even garbage, to cook. \"People here live amid garbage, all of us are sick, the smoke from the fires we burn makes us feel more sick,\" said. Swairki. \"The situation is just getting worse.\". Even as. Israel announced the changes to its deployment, analysts say any shift to lower-intensity fighting is possible only as. Israel establishes operational control over an area, meaning its forces can maneuver freely in the zone. Nearly three months into. Israel's war against. Hamas and other militants in the. Gaza. Strip,. Israel says it has broken the main command-and-control lines in the enclave's north and weakened them in the south, but small groups of. Hamas fighters continue to ambush. Israeli forces and fire rockets toward. Israel from across the. Strip. On. Monday morning,. Hamas showed it has retained long-range rocket capabilities intense barrage at. Tel. Aviv at the stroke of midnight. Two of the five. Israeli brigades set to rotate out of. Gaza are reservists, some of whom the military said will be demobilized. The remaining three are training brigades, which can be quickly redeployed into battle as needed. Since the start of the invasion of. Gaza, 173. Israeli soldiers have died and more than 900 have been wounded, according to the. Israeli military. A tent camp for displaced. Palestinians in. Rafah. The war has displaced 85 of. Gaza's population, the. U.N. says. Meanwhile, clashes continue across. Gaza. In. Gaza. City's. Shujaiyeh neighborhood, the. Israel military said on. Monday that its forces raided a command compound used allied group. Palestinian. Islamic. Jihad. In central. Gaza,. Israel said it killed a midranking officer commanding. Hamas's elite. Nukhba fighting force in. Deir al-Balah. In addition to operating in. Khan. Younis,. Israeli forces are also on the ground in. Khirbat. Ikhza'a, a border town that the military said was one of the launch points for. Hamas's. Oct. 7 attack. The. U.N. agency for. Palestinian refugees said. Friday that humanitarian aid deliveries to. Gaza are \"limited in quantities and riddled with logistical hurdles,\" saying. Israeli restrictions and airstrikes on the border areas are constraining the flow of aid. The. U.N. also said a breakdown in law and order and looting was also making it hard to secure convoys. \"There is a countdown to avert famine,\" said. Juliette. Touma, a spokeswoman for the agency. \"Much more food needs to get in.\". The. Israeli military said it works to facilitate aid into. Gaza and blamed logistical bottlenecks created by the. U.N. for the delays. The. World. Health. Organization said that crowded and unsanitary conditions are causing hundreds of thousands of cases of infectious diseases and stomach ailments. Most of. Gaza's hospitals are no longer functioning and those still able to take patients have limited treatment available. The. U.N.'s children's agency said. Friday that it had delivered 600,000 doses of vaccines for children into. Gaza. Latest news and key analysis, selected in the. January 2, , print edition as 'Israel. Reorganizes. Forces,.

Israel's. Supreme. Court has struck down a law passed in. July that would have taken away the court's powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be 'unreasonable in the extreme.'. TEL. AVIVIsrael's highest court has struck down a controversial judicial overhaul law enacted last year of. Prime. Minister. Benjamin. Netanyahu that would have limited the justices' power. While the broader overhaul sparked some of the worst political and social strife in. Israel in years, political leadersincluding. Netanyahu and his allieshave signaled that they will not fight. Monday's ruling while the country is embroiled in a devastating war in. Gaza. The law, which was passed in. July and was akin to a constitutional amendment, would have taken away the court's powers to abrogate government decisions it deems to be \"unreasonable in the extreme.\". Eight justices ruled in favor of striking down the law, with seven against it. The ruling comes with the country still reeling from the. Oct. 7 attack on southern. Israel that killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to. Israeli authorities. Before the attack, hundreds of thousands of. Israelis came out weekly to protest against. Netanyahu's push to weaken the powers of the court. Analysts say. Monday's ruling could have substantial consequences for postwar domestic politics, including any inquiry into the intelligence failures leading up to. Oct. 7. The ruling could eventually reignite a divisive national debate and provoke a constitutional crisis. And if. Netanyahu seeks to overturn the ruling in the short term, it could cause cracks to form within the multiparty emergency coalition formed to lead the country during the war. But for the moment,. Israelis are focused on the war effort. Thousands of. Israelis took part in a protest march last. July against the judicial overhaul plans. \"The public doesn't care about the judicial thing so much anymore,\" said. Barak. Medina, a legal scholar and professor at the. Hebrew. University of. Jerusalem. Groups that led the protests against the judicial overhaul welcomed the ruling but said a return to prewar divisions during the conflict was unlikely. \"We are in the midst of the longest and most horrible war in our history,\" said. Lee. Hoffman. Agiv, of the protest group. Bonot. Alternativa, or. Building an. Alternative. \"There won't be celebrations here.\". The law was part of a broader package of legislation aimed at limiting the court's power and giving more control to lawmakers. Netanyahu has argued that activist, liberal judges control the court and that the legislation seeks to restore a proper balance of power. Opponents charge that the legislation would undermine the court's role as a check on executive and legislative power and would erode. Israel's liberal democracy. Israel has no written constitution like the. U.S. and relies on a series of basic laws, which have special, quasi-constitutional status and delineate the basic tenets of the state such as electoral procedures, minting currency, and individual rights. Since the mid-s, the court has interpreted them as the country's constitution. In a decision that could have wide repercussions, the court also ruled 12-3 that it has the right to strike down a basic law in \"unusual and extreme cases\" when it goes against the core principles of. Israel as a. Jewish and democratic state. \"This is really an unprecedented decision because it is the first time in the history of the state where the court strikes down a basic law\" that is equivalent to a constitutional amendment, said. Yaniv. Roznai, a law professor at. Reichman. University in central. Israel. The court had never before struck down one of the basic laws, but had opined in various decisions that it had the authority to do so if the laws would alter the basic democratic character of the country. Netanyahu's. Likud party criticized the court's ruling, saying that \"it is unfortunate that the. Supreme. Court chose to issue a decision at the heart of. Israel's social divisions, precisely when. Israeli soldiers\" from across the political spectrum \"are fighting and risking their lives.\". Prime. Minister. Benjamin. Netanyahu has sought to limit the court's powers and give more control to the elected government. Justice. Minister. Yariv. Levin, considered the judicial overhaul's chief architect, said the court's ruling \"takes away from millions of citizens their vote and the basic right to be equal partners in decision-making.\". Levin has long argued that elected leaders should have more influence over the courts and their authority. Opposition. Leader. Yair. Lapid praised the decision as protecting. Israeli democracy. \"If the. Israeli government again starts the fight over the. Supreme. Court,\". Lapid said, then \"they learned nothing on. Oct. 7.\". The. Netanyahu government's judicial overhaul plan divided the country before the war, with some arguing that it conveyed weakness to. Israel's enemies and influenced the timing of the. Hamas attack. The ruling coalition has several options if it chooses to oppose the ruling, say legal analysts. This includes passing a more nuanced version of the reasonableness amendment or passing basic law legislation that would limit the ability of the court to strike down basic laws. President. Biden had urged. Netanyahu to slow down and seek a consensus with the political opposition on changes to the country's. Supreme. Court. Monday's ruling comes at a critical time for. Netanyahu, who has faced blowback at home about. Israel's failure to prevent. Hamas's. Oct. 7 attacks. The longtime leader has pushed back, saying that questions about his personal responsibility would be dealt with in a postwar inquiry. Without. Monday's ruling, courts would have little recourse to force the government to create a state commission of inquiry into. Israel's intelligence failures, said. Medina, the law professor. Only a state commission of inquiry can issue recommendations with serious weight, he added. If. Netanyahu takes steps to oppose the top court's ruling, it could undermine the working of the emergency government that was formed after the. Oct. 7 attack. Former. Defense. Minister. Benny. Gantz, who leads the. National. Unity alliance, was against the judicial overhaul. If. Gantz leaves the war cabinet,. Netanyahu's coalition, widely viewed as the most right-wing, nationalist and religious in the country's 75-year history, would be in charge of making decisions about the war. The emergency government was formed to establish some unity in the country after a period of polarization in. Israeli society and politics. \"The verdict must be respected, and the lesson from the conduct of the last year must be internalizedwe are brothers, we all have a common destiny,\". Gantz said after the ruling was announced. Latest news and key analysis, selected. More. Mr. Nice. Guy. In. Fighting. Trump,. Canada. Presents 'Mr. Elbows.'\n",

                                                                    The losers in a. California referendum are back again with a sneakier version. Jan. 1, 255 pm. ET 649 5 min. In. California they tried to get race preferences approved in a referendum, but voters rejected it 57.2 to 42.8. This was a stunning rebuke, not only because the rejection came from residents of a blue state but because the losing side had outspent opponents something like 14 to 1. In the. Supreme. Court weighed in with a landmark ruling that barred colleges from treating people as members of a racial group instead of as individualsand cast constitutional doubt on all race-based preferences. \"Eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it,\". Chief. Justice. John. Roberts wrote. Couldn't be clearer, right? Not in. California. Undaunted state. Assemblyman. Corey. Jackson is pushing a bill called. ACA7. It takes aim at the state ban on race preferences that voters put in the constitution in when they passed. Proposition 209. Californians reaffirmed. Proposition 209 three years ago at the ballot box. The language the voters agreed to and the activists hate reads as follows \"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\". Unlike the effort, the new bill would leave that language intact. Instead, it would add a provision allowing the governor to create \"exceptions.\". Effectively that would gut the ban. Apparently, the lesson the advocates of state-sponsored discrimination have taken from their defeat is that if at first you don't succeed, try something sneakier. Here is. Mr. Jackson's press release summarizing the bill \"ACA7 will allow . . . the. Governor to issue waivers to public agencies that wish to use state funds for research-based, or research-informed and culturally specific interventions to increase life expectancy, improve educational outcomes, and lift people out of poverty for specific ethnic groups and marginalized genders.\". Gail. Heriot is a. University of. San. Diego law professor who sits on the. U.S. Commission on. Civil. Rights and was a leader of both. Proposition 209 and the \"no\" effort on the referendum. She has launched a petition with. Extremely. Concerned. Californians at change.org opposing the measure. \"ACA7's proponents are hoping that voters will be fooled into thinking that it is just a small exception,\". Ms. Heriot says. \"In fact, it gives the governor enormous power to nullify. Proposition 209.\". Edward. Blum agrees. As the founder of. Students for. Fair. Admissions, he spearheaded the lawsuits against. Harvard and the. University of. North. Carolina that killed race preferences in college admissions. \"Racial preferences are never legally justified because some specious 'research' report concludes it would be beneficial to a certain race,\" says. Mr. Blum. \"This exemption will trigger endless litigation that will polarize. California citizens by race.\". But sowing discord is a feature, not a bug. As the bill was making its way through the. Assembly,. Mr. Jackson got in a spat with. Bill. Essaylia. Republican who is also the first. Muslim elected to the pointed out that the majority of. Californian voters disagree with state-sanctioned discrimination. \"I fundamentally disagree with this backwards policy,\" he later tweeted. Mr. Jackson responded in his own tweet \"This is a perfect example how a minority can become a white supremacist possible to win white supremacist and fascist affection.\". ACA7 passed the state. Assembly in. September. If it passes the. Senate, it will be on the ballot in. November. If. Californians vote yea, it will become part of the constitution. But all is not lost. The referendum awakened a sleeping giant the. Asian-American community. Asian-Americans quickly realized as the. Harvard case drove home that they and their children are the primary victims whenever race is substituted for merit. Asian-Americans are more aware and organized than they were in . They aren't likely to be fooled \"exceptions\" based on \"research.\". It also isn't a given that. ACA7 will make it through the state. Senate. Though. Democrats enjoy a 32-8 majority, polls consistently show race preferences are. Newsom's support will be crucial. Though he has no formal role in the constitutional process, some think the bill will go nowhere if. Mr. Newsom doesn't want it to. If it does make it to the ballot this. November, he'll be under immense pressure to endorse it. That's another reason the. Senate should kill. ACA7 now,. Ms. Heriot says. \"California voters need to make sure their state senators know where they standthrough emails, phone calls, letters, and petitions,\". Ms. Heriot says. \"Once the senators understand that, they will realize putting. ACA7 on the ballot is not in their interest.\". Journal. Editorial. Report.

U.S. troops launch. Himars during joint exercises in. East. Java,. Indonesia,. Sept. 11, . President. Biden on. Friday denounced. Russia for having \"launched its largest aerial assault on. Ukraine since this war began.\". The attack used some 158 missiles and drones to hit targets throughout the country. \"It is a stark reminder to the world,\". Mr. Biden said, that. Vladimir. Putin \"seeks to obliterate. Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped.\". Yet while. Russia can strike anywhere in. Ukraine, the. U.S. has denied the. Ukrainians the weapons they need to hit. Russian targets, even in the parts of. Ukraine that. Russia occupies. This raises the question. Does. Mr. Biden want. Ukraine to win? He has spoken about standing shoulder to shoulder with. Ukraine, about helping the country \"for as long as it takes\" and about not letting. Mr. Putin win. But the administration has never made a clear commitment to a. Ukrainian victoryto helping the country liberate all its legally recognized territory and become part of the. North. Atlantic. Treaty. Organization. Perhaps the reason for this reluctance is obvious. The. Biden administration doesn't want. Ukraine to win. Instead, there are signs the administration wants to force a sordid deal on. Kyiv, one in which. Ukrainians hand over large parts of their country, including. Crimea, to best evidence of this is that the administration has bent over backward not to supply. Ukraine with the weapons needed to hit. Russian targets in. Crimea. While the. U.S. has pumped about 50 billion of weaponry into. Ukraine, what it has given is rather one-dimensional. Washington has mostly sent weapons of limited range howitzers, artillery, fighting vehicles and ammunition and defensive weapons such as. Patriot antiair systems. The administration has temporized about sending longer-range weapons, even though the. U.S. has large stocks of them. One example is the limited way the. U.S. has supplied. Ukraine with. Himars ammunition. First appearing on the battlefield in early summer ,. U.S.-made. Himars, an acronym for. High-Mobility. Artillery. Rocket. Systems, showed their value with great accuracy and punch. Ukraine used. Himars to devastate. Russian ammunition and supply depots, helping stop the. Russian army in its tracks and leading to the liberation of much. Ukrainian territory around. Kharkiv and. Kherson. Yet the administration limited the type of. Himars ammunition it provided, making sure the. Ukrainians could attack. Russian forces only within about 50 miles of the frontleaving. Crimea off-limits. Predictably, after a few weeks of seeing their depots exploding, the. Russians moved their supply points more than 50 miles from the front, many to. Crimea. The. Ukrainians had no way to hit them. The administration's action had to be deliberate, as the. U.S. has significant stores of. Himars ammunition, known as. ATACMS for. Army. Tactical. Missile. Systems, which could reach targets in the internationally recognized territory of. Ukraine. No matter how often the. Ukrainians asked for. ATACMS, the answer was, until recently, no. Finally in. October, the. U.S. sent. Ukraine around 20. ATACMS. Ukraine used them against. Russian military helicopters and other targets that had been out of range. However far too few. ATACMS were sent. After a handful of successful operations,. Ukraine seems to have run out. In depriving the. Ukrainians of the ability to mount a sustained, long-range campaign against. Russia, the administration is leaving. Kyiv without the capability it needs to win. The ground war at the front in has made it clear that direct advances against prepared defensive positions are almost impossible. Both in the spring around the city of. Bakhmut and in the autumn around. Avdiivka, the. Russians made very slow progress at the cost of mass casualties and crippling equipment losses. The. Ukrainians, when supplied with. Western tanks and vehicles, struggled to advance this summer. In comparison, long-range weapons have been very effective. In the. U.K. and. France sent. Ukraine a few hundred of their. Storm. ShadowScalp cruise missiles. The systems are similar but have different names. These missiles enabled. Ukrainians to hit targets anywhere in. Crimea and to neuter. Russian naval power in the peninsula. The. Storm. ShadowScalps played a crucial role in the. Ukrainian attack on. Sevastopol in. September. Sevastopol was the headquarters of the. Russian. Black. Sea. Fleet, and. Moscow considered it relatively safe. Within moments, fire rained down on the base, damaging two major warships so badly that they haven't operated since. Last week the. Ukrainians used. Storm. ShadowScalps to sink the landing ship. Novocherkassk in. Crimea. The attack underscores. Crimea's vulnerability to long-range fire. Only the. Kerch. Bridge connects it to. Russia. As the. Russians are being driven from the naval bases, they will become almost entirely reliant on the bridge. If the. Ukrainians could stop movement across it,. Russian rule over. Crimea would be threatened. The. U.S. has many systems in addition to. ATACMS, such as. Joint. Air-to-Surface. Standoff. Missiles, that could help, but it isn't offering them. Arming. Ukraine with long-range systems would help. Ukraine liberate. Crimea and end the war sooner, saving lives on both sides. An administration that wants. Ukraine to win should see that and act accordingly. If the. Biden administration continues to hem and haw, after all we have seen in recent months, we can stop asking whether it wants. Ukraine to win the war. The answer would be no. Mr. O'Brien is a professor of strategic studies at the. University of. St. Andrews,. Scotland. The '. Reagan. National. Defense. Survey' highlights.

Soldiers line up on a ship's deck in. Zhoushan,. China,. Dec. 18. The good news about. U.S.-China relations is that last month the two countries restored military-to-military dialogue after a 16-month rupture. The bad news is that it hasn't slowed the military buildup in. Beijing, which increasingly appears to be on a wartime footing. The. U.S. needs to do likewise and reassemble what. President. Franklin. D. Roosevelt referred to as the nation's \"arsenal of democracy.\". Chinese leaders have articulated a long-term national strategy to achieve the \"great rejuvenation of the. Chinese nation on all fronts,\" including developing a world-class military. Over the past decade, the. Chinese. Communist. Party has ramped up defense industrial production and significantly improved its process of researching, developing and producing advanced weapons systems. As. Air. Force. Secretary. Frank. Kendall. III recently observed,. China is preparing \"specifically for a war with the. U.S.\". China's defense industrial efforts have strengthened its military capabilities. The. People's. Liberation. Army is amassing a formidable arsenal of medium- and long-range precision missiles capable of striking. U.S. and allied bases in the. Indo-Pacific. The. PLA is also building a web of integrated air-defense systems to challenge. U.S. forces in the region. Three of the world's 10 largest defense companies are now. Chinese enterprises. Aviation. Industry. Corp. of. China,. China. North. Industries. Group and. China. South. Industries. Group. The main beneficiary of. China's defense industrial growth is arguably the. PLA's navy. China is now the world's largest shipbuilder by a significant margin. Its shipbuilding capacity is more than 230 times as large as the. U.S.'s, allowing it to build 23 million tons of vessels, compared with less than 100,000 tons in the. U.S. One. Chinese shipyard, the. Jiangnan. Shipyard located on. Changxing. Island, has more capacity than all. U.S. shipyards combined, according to. U.S. Navy estimates. Beijing's buildup should be a blinking red light for. Washington. The. U.S. defense industrial base lacks the capacity, responsiveness, flexibility and surge capability to meet the military's needs. Part of the problem is that the. U.S. defense industrial base remains on a peacetime footing, despite wars in. Ukraine and the. Middle. East, as well as growing tension in the. Taiwan. Strait and. Korean. Peninsula. The. U.S. faces a serious shortfall of munitionsespecially long-range precision munitionsfor a protracted war in the. Indo-Pacific. That is owing in some part to. Congress's dragging its feet in fixing contracting problems, such as multiyear procurement. Supply-chain challenges remain serious, too, leading to an insufficient supply of solid rocket motors, ball bearings, microelectronics, and seekers for munitions. Today's workforce is also inadequate to meet the demands of the defense industrial base. Yet the. U.S. private sector is the most innovative in the world, and it boasts a strong track record of revitalizing its defense industrial base during periods of crisis, such as during. World. War. II and the. Cold. War. There is, however, a long way to go. A good place to start is at the. White. House. Presidents. Roosevelt,. Harry. Truman,. Dwight. Eisenhower and. Ronald. Reagan established defense production boards to provide strategic guidance, oversee. U.S. defense production, fix bureaucratic problems among executive agencies, and provide a sense of urgency. A national-level body is critical to oversee such a project of revitalization. The. Defense. Department and. Congress should also allocate additional funding and other enticementssuch as tax incentives, regulatory relief and long-term contractsto build and maintain production capacity. This funding could be used to modernize and expand defense facilities and develop flexible production. These steps will likely require an increase in defense spending. The. U.S. is spending roughly 3 of its gross domestic product on defense, compared with 14 under. Truman, 11 under. Eisenhower, 9 under. John. F. Kennedy and more than 6 under. Reagan. FDR in. December , a year before. Pearl. Harbor, implored the nation to revitalize its defense industry \"We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war.\". We need to heed that advice again before it's too late. Mr. Jones is senior vice president and director of the. International. Security. Program at the. Center for. Strategic and. International.

ET 4 min. The. McCombs. Avenue grade separation under construction during a high-speed rail project in. Kern. County,. Calif.,. April 19, . It didn't get a lot of attention, but last month the. White. House awarded 3.1 billion to the. California. High-Speed. Rail project. This was supposed to be a bullet train connecting. San. Francisco and. Los. Angeles in less than three hours. Instead, its costs keep rising even as the state scales back the plan. Since , when. California voters authorized a 10 billion bond issue for the train, they've been sold a bill of goods. The original total estimated construction cost to taxpayers was 33 billion. That's risen to at least 100 billion. The authority decided to offer service between. San. Francisco and. Los. Angeles in. Phase. I, then eventually extend the train service north to. Sacramento and south to. San. Diego. Phase. I was to have been completed by . Within five years of the bond approval, costs had soared so high that the. California. High-Speed. Rail. Authority had to adopt an emergency plan to contain them. One idea was to slow down the trains tracks with conventional commuter trains in parts of the. San. Francisco and. Los. Angeles areas. That reduced projected costs dollarsbut made a mockery of the \"high speed\" rail claim. In newly inaugurated. Gov. Gavin. Newsom declared that because of construction complications and cost overruns, the train would initially travel only down a 171-mile segment between. Merced a 130-mile drive from. San. Francisco and. Bakersfield 110 miles from. Los. Angeles. That segment was to cost 22.8 billion. Then the. California. High-Speed. Rail. Peer. Review. Committee dropped another bomb. The. San. Francisco to. Los. Angeles phase would take another 15 to 20 years to build, would cost three times as much as projected, and would be unable to meet legally mandated trip times. About the same time, the nonpartisan. Legislative. Analyst's. Office highlighted a 10 billion to 12 billion funding shortfall for the. Merced-to-Bakersfield segment, though only a year before the. California. High-Speed. Rail. Authority's. Business. Plan had said \"revenues would be roughly equivalent to costs.\". The federal grant will pay for less than one-third of the year's cost overrun. In legislative testimony,. Louis. S. Thompson, chairman of the. Peer. Review. Committee, put the. Phase. I funding gap at 93 billion to 103 billion. He also noted there is at least an 8 billion increase that hasn't been counted in the. Southern. California segment. \"Even with a realistic of new federal funding,\" he said, \"the project cannot get outside the. Central. Valley without added state or local funding.\". The. Legislative. Analyst's. Office agreed. Future cost escalation seems likely on the. San. Francisco and. Los. Angeles legs of. Phase. I, with massive tunneling through the. Tehachapi. Mountains toward. Los. Angeles and below the. Coast. Range toward. San. Francisco. The committee concluded that \"there is no existing federal program anywhere near the scale or sustaining level needed. There will need to be significant and sustained additional. State funding on a predictable and adequate level.\". But the. Legislative. Analysts's. Office has announced a 68 billion deficit, slamming that window shut for nowunless more federal money is on the way. Meanwhile,. Florida has a new rail system up and running between. Orlando and. Miami, with all private financing. Florida also has a state budget surplus. Mr. Cox is a senior fellow with the. Committee to. Unleash. Prosperity and principal of. Demographia, a.
